"""pylint as a tool.

A plugin: any callable named *_tool in this directory is discovered and
registered. Nothing imports this file explicitly. Move it out of tools/ to
uninstall.

Category 1 in Future_Router.md — fully mechanical, so it belongs in system
space rather than as prompt text. Raw pylint output on a 1000-line file runs
~2400 tokens, more than a --low-vram context window holds. This returns ~150.
The rule that makes that work: aggregate, never dump.
